# Learning Scala for Machine Learning

This project is to collect my practices for learning Scala, focusing on the purpose of building machine learning-based products, with a Python programming background. 

I think the above is a good starting point, because a lot of machine learing practioners start from Python, due to its own strong machine learning and scientific computing communities, including Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, among many. Nevertheless, some of ML practioners, including me, would like to step further, into Scala world, to more directly contribute to production. That's why I start this project.

Stay tuned. :-)
